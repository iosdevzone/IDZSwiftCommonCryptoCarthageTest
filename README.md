# IDZSwiftCommonCryptoCarthageTest 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iosdevzone/IDZSwiftCommonCryptoCarthageTest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iosdevzone/IDZSwiftCommonCryptoCarthageTest)

A simple app project to test building and linking against IDZSwiftCommonCrypto using Carthage

This is currently failing because there is no developer cert. This can be solved using Travis encrypted environment variables (see http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables) and some scripts from Carthage (see https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/tree/master/script).
